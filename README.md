📚 About the Project
This project was developed as part of a university-level mobile development course.
The Mobile Invoice App is a proof-of-concept (demo) designed for dance class businesses to manage clients, courses, invoices, and sign-ups.
It was built using Android Studio with a local SQL database (SQLite) to demonstrate full-stack mobile CRUD operations.

The app's backend layer was extensively developed to support multiple entities, allowing seamless management of:

Clients

Courses

Invoices

Course Sign-ups

This project showcases practical application of Android fundamentals, database integration, and full CRUD functionality within a polished, mobile-friendly UI.

✨ Features
- Client Management — Add, edit, delete, and view client profiles.

- Course Management — Set up and manage available dance courses.

- Invoice Generation — Create and track invoices for client enrollments.

- Sign-up Tracking — Record and manage client sign-ups for classes.

- Search Functionality — Quickly search clients, courses, and invoices.

- SQLite Backend — Built-in database to persist all user and class data.

- Responsive UI — Designed with Android Studio’s XML layout system.
